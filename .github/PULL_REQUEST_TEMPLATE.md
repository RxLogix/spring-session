Use domain-based naming conventions like caseObject, reportObject, signalObject.
- [ ]  Ensure proper logging information (info, error, or debug).
- [ ]  Ensure code styling, code alignment, proper spacing, code comments, and error handling. Ensure the best and proper data type used instead of using “def “(in groovy) or any generic data type.
- [ ]  Ensure code additions pass linting checks and unit tests, ensuring sufficient coverage to prevent disruptions to existing functionality.
- [ ]  Ensure unit test added/updated.
- [ ]  Ensure IDE (in-built) feature of code inspection is performed, and changes will not introduce redundant code, and code formatting issues.
- [ ]  Ensure code performance when loops are involved, and provide evidence when required.
- [ ]  Ensure new configurable parameter(s) is/are as per design changes and there is no duplicate parameter added.
- [ ]  Ensure removal of method/variable is covered properly along with usage removal.
- [ ]  Ensure code changes are as per design and requirement. Ensure change impact is assessed across the products.
